I suggest that published products - be they commercial, "shareware" or freeware - should, somewhere in the "About Box" or its equivalent, say "RBSplitView by Rainer Brockerhoff", with a link to http://www.brockerhoff.net/ if possible. A copy of the software itself would also be appreciated, and/or an e-mail telling me where you used it. If you make a significant modification to the source code, or find some bug, please e-mail me or post it in the Source Forum.
