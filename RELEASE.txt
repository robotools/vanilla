To create a new release on PyPI, creat an annotated git tag with a new
version tag of the form:

   v0.0.0

The version should be higher than the current one.

Then push the tags to the repository. GitHub Actions will do the rest.

Example:

  $ git tag -a v0.1.2 -m "Version v0.1.2"
  $ git push --follow-tags

And wait for GH Actions to do its work. The new release should be
visible at:

  https://pypi.org/project/cocoa-vanilla/
